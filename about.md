### - About Me # 

I am a front-end developer and
will hopefully be a full stack developer quite soon.

I am 22 and pursuing a B.E in Computer Sciences. I grew up in Srinagar,
Kashmir and currently live in Chandigarh

<br />
<br />

### - Methods & Workflow
    
My workflow consists of one editor (mostly Sublime), Google Chrome,
Slack and a terminal. (And a mixtape on infinite loop).


I write most of my front-end code using new and trusted web 
standards. I prefer using more flexible
frameworks like [Jeet]/Singularity to make mobile-first and responsive websites instead of Bootstrap.

 
<br />
<br />

### - Code and Implementation


I prefer writing CSS using [Stylus] and [SASS] (although I find Stylus much more
powerful than SASS) and use JS as the scripting language. 

I also have some experience working with making apps/websites in Node.js and Ruby on Rails.

### - Jibber Jabber

When not learning/writing code and about computers, I sometimes 
play with my band, mess around with my desktop config or cook 
disastrous dishes for everyone.

This blog was made with jekyll, a static site generator that runs on
Ruby. I've styled it with SASS (for now) and swagger.
