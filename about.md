### - About Me # 


I am a Computer Science Engineer and a Web Developer with 4+ yrs of experience & a passion for web standards. 
My work includes using bestâ€“practice techniques to deliver fast, 
responsive & mobile-first websites with good web typography & UI/UX design. 
I love & support all things UNIX/Open Source. 


<br />
<br />

### - Methods & Workflow
    
My workflow consists of one editor (mostly Sublime), Google Chrome,
Slack and a terminal. (And a mixtape on infinite loop).


I write most of my front-end code using new and trusted web 
standards. I prefer using more flexible
frameworks like [Jeet]/Singularity to make mobile-first and responsive websites instead of Bootstrap.

 
<br />
<br />

### - Code and Implementation


I prefer writing CSS using [Stylus] and [SASS] (although I find Stylus much more
powerful than SASS) and use JS as the scripting language for DOM manipulation. 

I also have some experience working with making apps/websites in Node.js and Ruby on Rails.

When not learning/writing code and about computers, I sometimes 
play with my band, mess around with my desktop config or cook 
disastrous dishes for everyone.

This blog was made with jekyll, a static site generator that runs on
Ruby. I've styled it with SASS (for now) and swagger.
