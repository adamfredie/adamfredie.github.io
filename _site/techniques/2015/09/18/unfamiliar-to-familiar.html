<p>This post is about understanding how getting familiar with
something can help us learn and understand it better.</p>

<br /></p>

<p>Rich Hickey talks about how we interact with new things and how we
learn or create. He has given talks about this in many events where he explained how ‘easy’ and ‘simple’ are not the same thing. And how ‘easy’ can end up creating complications while keeping it ‘simple’ can keep things less complex and productive.</p>

<p>More about that directly from the one and the only -</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0">Rails Conf 2012 Keynote: Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Although I did not really fully understand what he meant by that, but I did get was what he meant when he talked about getting familiar with something to learn about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Use it. Understand how it works. Get better. “</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not even know this was happening with me until I read that quote. Lately when I start learning something, I try to get some idea of the basics and how it works. Then I just google a guide about it and build it instead of learning from the ground up. I do this for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don’t usually get everything in the first go.</li>
  <li>I am too impatient to learn from scratch.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/g8GfH3i5F0hby.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>This wasn’t always the case though. Earlier, I was scared of trying new things. I didn’t really like to go out of my comfort zone. I did the “easy thing”. And since learning something entirely new could be confusing, I would refrain from doing such things.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you never try anything new, you will never learn anything new.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets take an example.</p>

<p>You want to learn to build with Ruby on Rails but have no idea about how to write anything in Ruby. You don’t know the syntax or the features the language provides. But, you have read about the framework and really want to try it. Great! Try it!</p>

<p>Google a little about the Ruby language and what Ruby on Rails is.
How it can be used and all the beginner’s info you can get.</p>

<p>Then google a guide about building basic applications with Ruby on Rail. Follow the guide step-by-step and do everything it says. You may or may not get everything from that the first time. And that’s exactly what I am writing about. You don’t have to get everything or most of the things the first time! Take some turns doing the same things again and again until you start understanding what its all about and how things work. After trying it a few times, you obviously won’t understand everything but you will feel more comfortable with it. That’s all you really need to learn something new. Just let it seem like it’s something you know even though you don’t.</p>

<p>Don’t hesitate to try new things. If you never try anything new, you
will never learn anything new <abbr title="in my opinion">(IMO)</abbr>.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="is-this-only-for-people-who-write-code">Is this only for people who write code?</h3>

<p>Not really. You can take an idea from somewhere and apply it in a field that is entirely different  and it may work just the same.</p>

<p>Getting familiar with things helps us understand them better because we feel more comfortable using them. And that in turn helps us learn it better.
You can call it a kind of practice before really trying the actual
thing. Like a little warm up of sorts.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="keep-learning">Keep Learning</h3>

<p>Never hesitate to try/learn something new. It’s always fun and refreshing to learn new things. And a necessity for someone who writes code for a living.</p>
